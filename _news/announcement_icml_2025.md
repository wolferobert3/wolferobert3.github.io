Excited to share that our research developing new methods for [understanding privacy threats in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13819) has been accepted to [**ICML 2025**](https://icml.cc/). Congrats to two fantastic lead authors, AI privacy and fairness researcher [Lucas Rosenblatt](https://lucasrosenblatt.com/) and deep learning and spatial computing researcher [Bin Han](https://beanham.github.io/)!
