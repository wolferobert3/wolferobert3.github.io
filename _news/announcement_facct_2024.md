Excited to be presenting two papers in person at [**ACM FAccT 2024**](https://facctconference.org/2024/) on June 3 and 4 in Rio de Janeiro. Read research with [Dr. Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) and the [Volitional AI Lab](https://billhowelab.github.io/) about the [competitiveness of small open models with large proprietary models like ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16820), or research with [Dr. Tanu Mitra](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/) about the [impacts and challenges of generative AI on the fact-checking profession](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15985).
