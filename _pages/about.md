I'm an incoming Assistant Professor at Rutgers University in the School of Communication and Information (SC&I), where I'll continue my research on the epistemic risks and opportunities of modern AI systems starting in fall of 2025. My research considers: 

* [Small-scale approaches to generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16820) that can help researchers and practitioners avoid dependence on proprietary technologies, especially in situations where sensitive data is involved, or reproducibility is paramount.
* Creating novel dimensions in the [design space of generative technologies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15985) to help maximize transparency in high-stakes epistemic settings such as fact-checking.
* Understanding the nature of undesirable AI biases related to protected demographic characteristics such as [race and ethnicity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10764.pdf), [nationality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00691.pdf), [age](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11378.pdf), and [gender](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3593013.3594072), most often in multimodal language-and-image models.

I'll be in Seattle through August 2025 finishing up an interim postdoc with Bill Howe's [Volitional AI Lab](https://billhowelab.github.io/). Please don't hesitate to reach out by email if you'd like to discuss research.
