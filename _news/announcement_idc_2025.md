I'm a co-author on three papers at [**IDC 2025**](https://idc.acm.org/2025/) - all first-authored by the unstoppable child-centered AI researcher [Aayushi Dangol](https://adango26.github.io/)! 

Check out her research on how to use [abstract reasoning puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16034) to help kids understand AI limitations, what the development of large reasoning models means for [AI literacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16031), and how kids [envision and evaluate generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16089).
