Very pleased to have had the opportunity to present two papers in person at **ACM FAccT 2022**. Read about [research on the one-drop rule in visual semantic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10764) with [Dr. Mahzarin R. Banaji](https://banaji.sites.fas.harvard.edu/) and [Dr. Aylin Caliskan](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~aylin/), or [research on markedness in visual semantic AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11378.pdf) with [Dr. Aylin Caliskan](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~aylin/).
