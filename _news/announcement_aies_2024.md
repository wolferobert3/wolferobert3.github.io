I'm excited to be sharing new research at [**AIES 2024**](https://facctconference.org/2024/), this October 21-23 in Santa Clara, CA. We've made preprints available for our accepted work on [representation bias of adolescents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01961), the impact of dataset scale and societal consistency on [bias in vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01959), a new [embedding measurement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01966) for social science, and a study of how generative AI is used in [human-centered data science work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01962). Please get in touch if you'd like to connect in Santa Clara this October!
