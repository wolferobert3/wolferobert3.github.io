I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science at the University of Washington advised by [Dr. Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) and [Dr. Alexis Hiniker](https://www.alexishiniker.com/), studying the epistemic risks and opportunities of modern AI systems. Specifically, my research considers: 

* [Small-scale approaches to generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16820) that can help researchers and practitioners avoid dependence on proprietary technologies, especially in situations where sensitive data is involved, or reproducibility is paramount.
* Creating novel dimensions in the [design space of generative technologies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15985) to help maximize transparency in high-stakes epistemic settings such as fact-checking.
* Understanding the nature of undesirable AI biases related to protected demographic characteristics such as [race and ethnicity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10764.pdf), [nationality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00691.pdf), [age](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11378.pdf), and [gender](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3593013.3594072), most often in multimodal language-and-image models.

I'm grateful to have been a part of great communities doing critically important work during my time at UW, including Bill Howe's [Volitional AI Lab](https://billhowelab.github.io/) and Dr. Alexis Hiniker's [User Empowerment Lab](https://www.userempowerment.org/). I'm also grateful to have had the chance to learn from and work with an incredible group of faculty members at the iSchool, including most recently [Dr. Tanu Mitra](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/). Please don't hesitate to reach out by email if you'd like to discuss research.
