I had the opportunity to attend the workshop on [Mobilizing Research and Regulatory Action on Dark Patterns and Deceptive Design Practices](https://chi2024.darkpatternsresearchandimpact.com/) on May 12, 2024 at **ACM SIGCHI 2024**. I presented a position paper co-authored with [Dr. Alexis Hiniker](https://www.alexishiniker.com/) about deceptive design patterns on the OpenAI GPT Store.
