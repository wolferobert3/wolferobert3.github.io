I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Science at the University of Washington advised by [Dr. Aylin Caliskan](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/aylin). My interests are in natural language processing, machine learning, and AI ethics.

My research examines:

* How underrepresentation of marginalized groups in text training corpora impacts [bias in contextualizing language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00672.pdf) like BERT, GPT-2, and T5
* Intrinsic evaluation and semantic geometry of contextualizing language models
* Semantic change in regional and diachronic static word embeddings
* What multimodal models like CLIP learn about human populations (and why it matters)

Before moving to Seattle in August 2021 I finished up an M.S. in Computer Science at the George Washington University. In a past life (my early 20s) I studied Appalachian literature and rhetorical ecologies with regard to U.S. state-level secession movements. Always up for book recommendations, recipes for ribs, tips on hiking in the Seattle area, and opportunities to socialize with dogs.
