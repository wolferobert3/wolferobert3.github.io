I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Science at the University of Washington advised by [Dr. Aylin Caliskan](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/aylin). My interests are in AI ethics, natural language processing, and machine learning.

My research examines:

* How frequency in text training corpora impacts [bias in language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00672.pdf)
* How properties like contextualization, tokenization, and anisotropy affect measurements of [semantics in contextualized word embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07504)
* How representations of natural language are affected by [multimodal visual semantic pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07511.pdf)

I studied literature during my first time through graduate school, and I'm always up for book recommendations, recipes for ribs, and tips on hiking in the Seattle area. I'm best reached by email.
